🚀 Project Summary: ChemViz
Core Objective: Developed a high-performance web application to simplify chemical data visualization through an interactive 3D interface and a dynamic Periodic Table.

Technical Implementation: Leveraged React 18 and Vite for a modern, responsive frontend, ensuring sub-second load times and efficient state management.

Key Functionalities:

Integrated a 3D Molecular Viewer allowing users to interactively manipulate molecular structures (Zoom/Rotate/Scale).

Engineered a Dynamic Periodic Table with real-time filtering and detailed property analysis for all 118 elements.

FOSS Alignment: Built entirely using Free and Open Source Software, adhering to the core mission of the FOSSEE initiative.

Scalability: Organized with a modular component-based architecture, making the codebase easy to maintain and extend with new chemical datasets.

Deployment: Successfully hosted on Netlify with a continuous integration pipeline linked to the GitHub repository for real-time updates.
