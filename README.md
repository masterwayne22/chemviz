# Chemical Equipment Parameter Visualizer (Hybrid Web + Desktop App)

---

### 🚀 Project Summary: ChemViz
* **Core Objective:** Developed a high-performance web application to simplify chemical data visualization through an interactive 3D interface and a dynamic Periodic Table.
* **Technical Implementation:** Leveraged **React 18** for a modern, responsive frontend, ensuring sub-second load times and efficient state management.
* **Key Functionalities:**
    * **3D Molecular Viewer:** Allows users to interactively manipulate molecular structures.
    * **Dynamic Periodic Table:** Real-time filtering and detailed property analysis for all 118 elements.
* **FOSS Alignment:** Built entirely using Free and Open Source Software, adhering to the core mission of the **FOSSEE initiative**.
* **Scalability:** Organized with a modular component-based architecture for easy maintenance and expansion.
* **Deployment:** Successfully hosted on Netlify with a CI/CD pipeline linked to GitHub.
* License: This project is open-source and released under the MIT License.
