⚗️ ChemViz — Industrial Parameter Visualization Platform

FOSSEE Internship Screening Task | IIT Bombay (2026)

A hybrid web + desktop scientific visualization system for analyzing industrial equipment parameters from structured datasets.

🚀 Live Demo

🌐 Web Dashboard:
👉 https://eloquent-unicorn-ef2d76.netlify.app/

🌐 Deployment Note:

The web dashboard is deployed on Netlify as a static frontend demonstration.

Due to hosting constraints, the Django REST analytics backend is not publicly deployed.

Full CSV processing and API computations require running the backend locally.

🧠 Project Overview

ChemViz is a unified data visualization and analytics platform designed for:

Chemical engineering students

Researchers

Industrial dataset analysis

The system provides:

✅ Centralized Python backend for data processing & analytics

✅ High-performance web dashboard for visualization

✅ Native desktop application for offline monitoring

Goal:

Reduce dependency on proprietary industrial visualization tools

Provide an open-source, extensible scientific analytics framework

🏗️ System Architecture

📥 CSV Dataset Upload
↓

🧠 Django REST Analytics API
↓

React Web Dashboard   |   PyQt5 Desktop Client

🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 Backend Engine

Django + Django REST Framework (DRF) — Centralized analytics API

Pandas — Dataset parsing & statistical computations

SQLite — Persistence for last 5 dataset uploads

🔹 Web Frontend

React 18 + Vite — High-performance UI rendering

Chart.js — Interactive scientific plots

Tailwind CSS — Industrial dark-mode dashboard UI

🔹 Desktop Frontend

PyQt5 — Native desktop monitoring application

Matplotlib — Scientific plotting and trend visualization

⚡ Core Features
📥 CSV Data Processing

Automatic parsing of:

Equipment Name

Equipment Type

Flowrate

Pressure

Temperature

📊 Analytics API

Global averages of industrial parameters

Equipment-type distribution statistics

🧠 Smart Dataset History

Stores and toggles between the last 5 uploaded datasets

🖥️ Industrial Control Panel UI

High-contrast dark theme optimized for technical environments

📄 PDF Reporting (Planned)

Automated dataset summary and equipment log reports

⚠️ Current Limitation

After uploading a dataset, the web frontend requires a manual page refresh to retrieve updated analytics from the backend API.

This is due to the current request-based update mechanism and will be replaced with real-time synchronization in future versions.
